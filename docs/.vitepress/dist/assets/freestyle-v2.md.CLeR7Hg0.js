All sockets are well protected by the CNC case that provides durability, RF shielding and improved signal integrity. A wire harness is included for solderless connection for power and MSP UART port. The antenna and MIPI cable are secured by the included retention bar and screws.</p><p>Freestyle V2 VTX is capable of 1W RF output on channel R1 – output decreases as frequency increases. From the factory, the VTX is limited to 200mW output.

In some cases, it is necessary to mount the VTX with double-sided tape rather than screws to avoid electrical noise when the craft’s motors are armed.</p><p>Freestyle V2 VTX consumes up to 15W. If it is connected with FC that has a built-in BEC output, make sure the BEC can provide enough current. For example, if the BEC provides 10V, it needs a minimum of 1.5A current output.</p><p>When using GPS, keep it physically separated from the Freestyle V2 VTX—especially the antenna—to minimize interference with the GPS signal.</p>',13)])])}const T=e(c,[["render",p]]);export{y as __pageData,T as default};
