What causes the red LED on my VTX to blink, or not show up at all?</strong></p><p>A1: The RED LED should be on and not blinking. Please check the following:</p><ul><li>Check power connection to your VTX;</li><li>Make sure input voltage is within range, see <a href="./vtx-summary.html">Power Input</a>;</li><li>Ensure the power source can provide sufficient current. A 200mW VTX draws around 5 watts, while a Freestyle VTX can require up to 15 watts. Keep in mind, some flight controllers (FCs) may not be capable of supplying adequate amperage.</li><li>The VTX&#39;s power circuit may be damaged, which can result in no red LED or a blinking red LED indicator.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Q2. What causes the blue LED on my VTX to blink, or not show up at all?</strong></p><p>A2: The blue LED reflects the current status of the VTX as follows:</p><ul><li>Absence of the blue LED suggests a critical failure—your VTX may be completely non-operational.</li><li>Upon boot, three rapid blue LED flickers confirm MSP communication is active, if it is connected with a flight controller</li><li>The blue LED should remain steadily lit under normal operating conditions.</li><li>Check LED pattern table if the <a href="./vtx-led.html#blue-led-pattern">blue LED blinks</a></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Q3. Why am I experiencing snow noise at minimal range?</strong></p><p>A3: Under normal conditions, video quality should remain clear at short distances. Please verify the following:</p><ul><li>Check if the VTX is set to P1MW mode—this is indicated by one long flash followed by two short blue LED flashes.</li><li>The VTX is configured for high RF power output, and placing the goggles or receiver too close causes signal saturation.</li><li>Position the radio receiver (RX) and its antenna away from the video transmitter (VTX) on the drone to minimize signal interference.</li><li>Lower the transmit (TX) RF power and increase the separation between the TX and your HDZero goggles or receiver.</li><li>Do not place VTX next to ESC board.</li><li>VTX (antenna side) must have 5mm vertical clearance.</li><li>Replace VTX antenna or pigtail to ensure proper signal transmission.</li><li>Verify if another VTX (analog, DJI, HDZero) is operating on the same channel.</li><li>Identify potential Wi-Fi interference; overlapping frequencies typically produce diagonal noise patterns.</li><li>Faulty RF circuit on the VTX</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Q4: My video feed is working but why is no OSD displayed?</strong></p><p>A4: Here is how HDZero OSD works: HDZero VTX communicates using the MSP protocol to retrieve telemetry data from the flight controller, then transmits this data wirelessly to the goggles or receiver, where it&#39;s overlaid onto the video stream.</p><p>Ensure proper VTX–FC connection by checking the following:</p><ul><li>VTX/Goggle/Receiver Firmware mismatch: Update both VTX/Goggle/Receiver to the latest firmware</li><li>Wire connection: UART TX/RX of FC board should be connected with RX and TX pads of VTX respectively.</li><li>Betaflight setting: See OSD instruction</li><li>The UART port on the FC could be damaged. Try another UART port on FC (avoid using soft-serial and SA ports),</li><li>Try another FC</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Q5: Why does my video signal become noisy when I arm the quad and apply throttle?</strong></p><p>A5: This might be caused by noisy/insufficient power to VTX. Verify the following:</p><ul><li>If VTX is powered by a BEC of FC, make sure the BEC is capable of supplying adequate amperage.</li><li>Install a large capacitor (≥350µF, 50V) across the battery leads.</li><li>It may be due to the radio transmitter affecting the video receiver. Lower TX power and place well away from the goggles or video receiver.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Q6: Why can’t I receive video with my goggle?</strong></p><p>A6: It’s a complex issue that could involve multiple components—namely the camera, MIPI cable, VTX, or goggles. Verify the following</p><ul><li>Blue LED is not solid on: <ol><li>If the blue LED is completely off, it means VTX is bad;</li><li>If the blue LED flashes one long and one short periodically, the VTX is in 0mW mode. Use <a href="./vtx-general.html#stick-command-gestures">stick command</a> to exit 0mW mode</li><li>If the blue LED flashes 2 shorts periodically, it indicates that the VTX is unable to detect the camera, it could be (1) damaged camera; (2) bad MIPI cable; (3) loose MIPI cable connection; (4) damaged MIPI connectors on camera and/or VTX; (5) damaged VTX</li><li>Check other <a href="./vtx-led.html#blue-led-pattern">blue LED patterns</a></li></ol></li><li>Blue LED is solid on: <ol><li>Verify whether the VTX is set to Low Band while the goggles are configured differently, or vice versa.</li><li>If the Nano90 camera is configured to 540p60 mode, the goggles must be set to HDZero BW = Narrow via the following path: Goggle Menu → Source → HDZero BW.</li></ol></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Q7. Why does the VTX fail to flash properly?</strong></p><img src="'+a+'" id="image25"><p>A7: Make sure all pins on the VTX and the firmware (FW) port of your goggles are perfectly straight—any bent or misaligned pins can disrupt the flashing process. Even a single crooked pin on the VRX module has been known to trigger flashing failures.</p><hr><p><strong>Q8: Why is my FC dropping to bootloader when connected to a HDZero VTX?</strong></p><p>A8. It has been reported that some flight controllers may randomly enter bootloader mode when connected to early-production HDZero VTX modules. To resolve this issue, add a 200-ohm resistor in-line between the FC UART.TX and VTX UART.RX wires.</p><p>All HDZero VTX units produced after 2023 already include this resistor by default, eliminating the need for manual fixes on newer hardware.</p>',37)])])}const m=o(l,[["render",n]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
