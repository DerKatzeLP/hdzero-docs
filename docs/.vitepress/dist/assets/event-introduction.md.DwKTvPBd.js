This means separate software is not needed to switch the recorded video between the two and no special setup is needed ahead of time.</p><p>The Event VRX outputs both HDZero and analog video on HDMI and CVBS outputs.

The 2-antenna HDZero receivers have less noise rejection than full goggle VRX’s with 4 antennas, but still have excellent video reception for outdoor race events. 8 analog receivers are included, setup in a diversity arrangement (2 analog receivers per channel).</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-label="Permalink to “Features”">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>Effortless HDZero and analog auto-switching receiver for racing events</p></li><li><p>4 channels per box, each of which can receive either an HDZero or analog signal</p></li><li><p>4x HDMI and 4x CVBS (composite analog) outputs so you can connect to HDMI capture cards or to legacy analog DVR recorders</p></li><li><p>Both digital and analog signals are output on HDMI and CVBS – system chooses video source based on signal</p></li><li><p>2x SMA antenna jacks that are shared between all 4 channels, so you only need 2 antennas for 4 channels of video</p></li><li><p>Rugged steel enclosure that is designed for mounting to a tower</p></li><li><p>2D De-interlacer improves analog video quality on HDMI output</p></li><li><p>OLED configuration screen for channel and setting changes</p></li><li><p>30W power draw, 8-20V DC input</p></li><li><p>AC to DC Power supply included</p></li><li><p>Firmware updates via USB and included Windows PC software</p></li></ul>',8)),n(t),n(o)])}const D=i(d,[["render",p]]);export{_ as __pageData,D as default};
