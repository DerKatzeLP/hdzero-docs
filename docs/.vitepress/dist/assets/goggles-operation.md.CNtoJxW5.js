There is a soft switch available in the goggle menu to turn on the power to the module bay. <strong>This must be turned on for the module bay to be powered and is off by default.</strong></p><p>The HDZero goggle uses a novel approach to process the analog input, resulting in improved analog video quality:</p><ul><li><p>It uses a video decoder with an adaptive comb filter to separate Y/C from the composite video;</p></li><li><p>It uses a deinterlacer to convert fields to frames, instead of doubling the interlaced lines;</p></li><li><p>It uses an upscaler to record and display the video;</p></li></ul><img src="'+c+'"><blockquote><p>FIG 4.

Note that the OLED brightness setting applies to the OLED display only.</p><p>If the HDZero goggle detects no movement or no key input for programmed time (1/3/5/7 minutes), it will dim the OLED display as an alarm, and it will wait for another one minute before turning off both the display and HDZero digital receiver with a short beep. The OLED display and HDZero receiver will resume normal operation if the goggle detects movement or any key input. This feature can be disabled by setting the waiting time to “Never”.</p><p>OLED displays can provide more vivid colors than traditional LCD panels, However, if they are displaying the same content for an extended period of time, it may come across issues like &quot;Image retention&quot; or &quot;Image burn-in&quot;. It is highly recommended to use the above OLED auto off feature or “Go Sleep” from main menu to turn off OLED while not using the goggle.</p><h2 id="dvr" tabindex="-1">DVR <a class="header-anchor" href="#dvr" aria-label="Permalink to “DVR”">​</a></h2><p>The HDZero goggles integrates a DVR for both the HDZero digital receiver and analog input. These are the DVR options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Automatic Record</strong>: DVR will start to record when it detects there is valid HDZero RF on the current channel, and stops recording when the signal is no longer detected.</p></li><li><p><strong>Manual Record</strong>: DVR will start/stop only if Func button is clicked.</p></li><li><p><strong>MP4 format or TS format</strong>: MP4 format is better supported by many video editing applications. However, MP4 files can be corrupted if the goggle loses power before the file is closed after recording, which can happen if the goggle runs out of battery or the power cord is unplugged unexpectedly. Unlike the MP4 format, the TS format saves the stream instantly to DVR without any risk of corrupted files, even if the goggle suddenly loses power. TS format is preferred.</p></li><li><p><strong>H264/H265</strong>. The DVR must use the H264 format when recording 90fps video (it records in 1280x720x90 for better quality). It uses the H265 format in all other cases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Audio</strong>: You can choose to record audio or not. There are 3 audio sources that can be recorded:</p><ul><li><p>Built-in microphone</p></li><li><p>Line in (From Line in/out port, usually from an external MIC)</p></li><li><p>AV in (From AV in Jack or built-in analog receiver audio output)</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>The file system on SD card can be corrupted by suddenly power off while goggle is writing data to it.</strong></p><p>HDZero Goggle operates on a Linux-based system, and it is unable to store final emergency data when powered off abruptly. This can result in corrupted SD card file systems and video files that won’t play. Here are tips on how to avoid powering off while recording is ongoing:</p><ul><li><p>Auto record mode: after quad is landed, do one of the following</p><ul><li><p>Long press “Enter” button to switch to menu mode, then power off the goggle, or</p></li><li><p>Power off quad first, and wait for 10 seconds, then power off the goggle</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Manual record mode: Click “Func” button to stop DVR before power off the goggle</p></li><li><p>Select “Scan and Fix” if Windows or Mac reports problem when SD card is inserted.</p></li></ul><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title custom-block-title-default">TIP</p><p>Note: It is convenient to start/stop DVR with ELRS backpack function.
