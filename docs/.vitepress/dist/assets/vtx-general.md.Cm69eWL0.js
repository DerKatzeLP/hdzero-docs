See <a href="./vtx-firmware-update.html">firmware update instructions</a> below.</p><h2 id="caution-ufl-connectors-are-fragile" tabindex="-1">Caution: UFL Connectors Are Fragile <a class="header-anchor" href="#caution-ufl-connectors-are-fragile" aria-label="Permalink to “Caution: UFL Connectors Are Fragile”">​</a></h2><p>All HDZero VTXes use a U.FL connector for its smaller footprint and lighter weight. However, it is not a mechanically strong connector. Treat it as if it’s made of glass. Here are notes for installing and uninstalling an antenna:</p><ul><li><p>Use the included brass or plastic retaining bar on VTXes that include it</p></li><li><p>If retaining bar is not used, never run a cable from the UFL connector straight off the side of a board. Instead, run the antenna cable towards the middle of the board, and secure it in one of the following ways as a strain relief:</p><ul><li><p>Temperature resistant glue like E6000</p><ul><li><p>Avoid using glue on top of the hot components on the board.</p></li><li><p>Preferably, apply glue to the side of the board where the cable leaves the top of the board.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Kapton tape to secure it to the surface of the VTX</p></li><li><p>Zip tie it to a nearby standoff (be careful not to crush the coax)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Unless you need maximum RF performance or minimum weight, consider a UFL-&gt;SMA pigtail for larger builds. This allows you to thoroughly secure the SMA connector to your aircraft to prevent movement of the antenna cable. Note: a common failure point with SMA connectors is where the coax cable is crimped to the SMA jack; if this joint snaps and is loose, RF performance will suffer greatly.</p></li><li><p>When removing the antenna, use care not to apply too much stress in any one direction. It is best to use a tweezer at the base of the neck of the connector and then pull straight up (do not pry), away from the board, so that force is evenly distributed on each supporting leg of the U.FL jack. There are tools designed to remove/insert UFL connectors from their sockets, which can help avoid damage to the UFL connector or socket.</p></li></ul><p>Please visit the following link for more information:</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/hdzero/permalink/448657693828864/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.facebook.com/groups/hdzero/permalink/448657693828864/</a></p><h2 id="powering-the-vtx-bec" tabindex="-1">Powering the VTX: BEC <a class="header-anchor" href="#powering-the-vtx-bec" aria-label="Permalink to “Powering the VTX: BEC”">​</a></h2><p>Using a battery eliminator circuit (BEC) is highly recommended to avoid voltage spikes, which can damage the VTX. Although you can power the VTX directly from the battery (VBAT), a BEC will provide more consistent power and will help absorb any voltage spikes, protecting your VTX from over-voltage conditions and under-voltage (brown-outs).</p><p>It is important to select a BEC that provides voltage that is within the range of what the VTX accepts, and that is capable of supplying enough current to power the VTX. Whether you are using a BEC that is built into your flight controller or a standalone BEC, be sure to check its voltage and current ratings and compare them to the required voltage and current for your VTX.</p><p>All the FCs that include an integrated BEC for DJI VTXes should also work for HDZero VTXes.</p><p>To summarize:</p><ul><li><p>Check your FC specs to see if you can run your VTX from the FC’s BEC;</p></li><li><p>If not, you could run the VTX from a suitable standalone BEC;</p></li><li><p>If not, running on VBAT is always the last choice due to the challenging voltage environment in an aircraft.</p></li><li><p>All HDZero VTXes, except Freestyle V2, do not support 6S VBAT.</p></li></ul><h2 id="mounting-considerations" tabindex="-1">Mounting Considerations <a class="header-anchor" href="#mounting-considerations" aria-label="Permalink to “Mounting Considerations”">​</a></h2><p>It is very important to keep some distance between the VTX and ESC/FC boards for the following reasons:</p><ul><li><p>The RF portion of VTX is vulnerable to electronic noise caused by ESC/motors;</p></li><li><p>The RF signal can be bounced back from surfaces of boards or carbon fiber plates, and fed back to the power amplifier in the VTX. This will deteriorate the RF signal integrity and could damage the amplifier.</p></li></ul><p>To avoid these concerns, follow this guidance for mounting the VTX:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Do not use tape to mount VTX to drone frame</strong> (except for Freestyle V2)</p></li><li><p>If the VTX is mounted on the top of the stack, please keep 5mm distance from the top carbon fiber plates.</p></li><li><p>Avoid mounting the VTX in the middle of the stack.</p></li><li><p>If the VTX is mounted on the bottom of the stack, the VTX needs to be upside down (U.FL socket faces down) and needs to have a minimum of 5mm distance from the bottom carbon fiber plates.</p></li></ul><h2 id="osd-msp-setup" tabindex="-1">OSD/MSP Setup <a class="header-anchor" href="#osd-msp-setup" aria-label="Permalink to “OSD/MSP Setup”">​</a></h2><h3 id="_1-pre-requisite" tabindex="-1">1.
