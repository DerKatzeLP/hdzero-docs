This Nano 90 camera supports 540p60 mode exclusively. When it is set to 540p60, the goggle needs to set Source &gt; HDZero BW to Narrow.</p><p>All other modes need to set Source &gt; HDZero BW to Wide.</p><p>Analog Receiver</p><p>The HDZero BoxPro takes analog video input from either the AV input jack or the built-in analog RF receiver.</p><p>The HDZero BoxPro uses a novel approach to process the analog input, resulting in improved analog video quality:</p><p>It uses a video decoder with an adaptive comb filter to separate Y/C from the composite video;</p><p>It uses a deinterlacer to convert fields to frames, instead of doubling the interlaced lines;</p><p>It uses an upscaler to record and display the video;</p><img src="'+s+`" id="image6"><p>FIG 4.

It cools the internals and prevents screen fogging.</p><p>The fan speed can be set to a 1-5 level, corresponding from minimum to max speed.</p><p>There are two control modes for side fans:</p><p>Automatic mode: Goggle firmware will automatically speed up/down;</p><p>Manual mode: You can manually set the speed for each fan;</p><p>Regardless of the current mode, top fan will go to max speed if temperature sensor reports a reading that is too hot.</p><p>You can change the fan speed by pressing and holding the Func Button. You can monitor the fan speed changes on the goggle OSD to quickly change the amount of air blowing onto your face and the optic lenses while in the Video view.</p><p>Image Settings</p><p>The HDZero goggle has an image processor to fine tune video before feeding to DVR and display. It includes:</p><p>Brightness</p><p>Saturation</p><p>Contrast</p><p>LCD Brightness</p><p>Note: &quot;Brightness&quot; refers to the image brightness processed by the video processor, while &quot;LCD Brightness&quot; pertains to the backlight of the LCD display.</p><p>LCD Auto Off</p><p>If the HDZero BoxPro detects no movement or no key input for programmed time (1/3/5/7 minutes), it will dim the LCD display as an alarm, and it will wait for another one minute before turning off both the display and HDZero digital receiver with a short beep. The LCD display and HDZero receiver will resume normal operation if the goggle detects movement or any key input. This feature can be disabled by setting the waiting time to “Never”.</p><p>It is highly recommended to use the above LCD auto off feature or “Go Sleep” from main menu to turn off LCD while not using the goggle.</p><p>DVR</p><p>The HDZero BoxPro integrates a DVR for the HDZero digital receiver, analog input (RF or AV in), and HDMI input. These are the DVR options:</p><p>Automatic Record: DVR will start to record when it detects there is valid HDZero RF on the current channel, and stops recording when the signal is no longer detected.</p><p>Manual Record: DVR will start/stop only if Func button is clicked.</p><p>MP4 format or TS format: MP4 format is better supported by many video editing applications. However, MP4 files can be corrupted if the goggle loses power before the file is closed after recording, which can happen if the goggle runs out of battery or the power cord is unplugged unexpectedly. Unlike the MP4 format, the TS format saves the stream instantly to DVR without any risk of corrupted files, even if the goggle suddenly loses power.</p><p>H264/H265. The DVR must use the H264 format when recording 90fps video (it records in 1280x720x90 for better quality). It uses the H265 format in all other cases.</p><p>Audio: You can choose to record audio or not. There are 3 audio sources that can be recorded:</p><p>Built-in microphone</p><p>Line in (From Line in/out Jack), aka external microphone</p><p>AV in (From AV in Jack)</p><p>Note:</p><p>The file system on SD card can be corrupted by suddenly power off while goggle is writing data to it. The HDZero BoxPro runs on Linux, and it does not have a big capacitor that saves power for saving the last emergency bits. The DVR will not work if SD file system is corrupted. Here are tips on how to avoid powering off while recording is ongoing:</p><ul><li><p>Auto record mode: after quad is landed, do one of the following</p></li><li><p>Long press “Enter” button to switch to menu mode, then power off the goggle, or</p></li><li><p>Power off quad first, and wait for 10 seconds, then power off the goggle</p></li><li><p>Manual record mode: Click “Func” button to stop DVR before power off the goggle</p></li><li><p>Select “Scan and Fix” if Windows or Mac reports problem when SD card is inserted.</p></li></ul><p>TABLE 3: DVR resolution</p><table id="table5"><tr><td></td><td>Input Source</td><td>Recording resolution</td><td>Encoder</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>HDZero 60fps Camera</td><td>1280x720x60fps</td><td>H.265</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>HDZero 90fps Camera</td><td>1280x720x90fps</td><td>H.264</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>NTSC</td><td>1280x720x59.97fps</td><td>H.265</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>PAL</td><td>1280x720x50fps</td><td>H.265</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>HDMI in</td><td>1280x720 (50,60, 90fps)<br>1920x1080 (50, 60fps)</td><td>H.264</td></tr></table><p>DVR for HDMI in</p><p>Here is how DVR works when source is set to HDMI in:</p><p>BoxPro will automatically start recording and:</p><p>Restart recording when HDMI in resolution changes.</p><p>Restart recording when recording time reaches 10 minutes.</p><p>Stop recording when HDMI in source is lost.</p><p>Stop recording when SD card storage is less than 100MB or SD card is ejected.</p><p>Note: When source is set to HDMI in, there is no Goggle OSD, include recording icon, battery status, etc.</p><p>Playback</p><p>The HDZero BoxPro can play back DVR recordings.</p><p>The player lists the recent recording first. Use Dial up/down to select a file, and click to play it</p><p>On controller bar, use Dial Up/Down to seek video (5 seconds forward/backward), and click to play/pause</p><p>Long press the Enter button to exit the controller bar, and long press Enter again to exit the player.</p><p>Note: The player will ignore files that are less than 5MB.</p><p>OSD</p><p>The goggle supports OSD from flight controller (FC OSD) and OSD of its own status (Goggle OSD). You may select if both OSD should be recorded with video stream at Record Options sub-menu.</p><p>Goggle OSD can be shown/ hidden by clicking the Enter button under Video view. The positions of Goggle OSD items can be changed at OSD | Adjust OSD Elements.</p><p>The goggle has built-in OSD fonts for BetaFlight, Arduino and iNav. It will automatically load the corresponding font according to type of flight controller that is connected with HDZero video transmitter. You can also customize FC OSD by putting bitmap files under SD card root directory/resource/OSD/FC.</p><p>Note: When source is set to HDMI in, there is no Goggle OSD, include recording icon, battery status, etc.</p><p>Tune Channel</p><p>By Dialing up/down, video channel number can be tuned on video mode for HDZero receiver input. However, this can be disabled by putting a file named as “no_dial.txt” on SD card root directory when booting up.</p><p>WiFi Module (Optional)</p><p>The HDZero BoxPro supports WIFI video streaming to smart phone, desktop or laptop, if it includes WIFI/ESP32 module. Multiple devices can wirelessly connect to the goggle and receive the video simultaneously.</p><p>Control over the behavior of the WiFi Module is completely managed from within the WiFi Module page. Users have the ability to configure the goggle as a Host (Access Point) or a Client (Join Network).</p><p>WiFi Module page supports both “Basic” and “Advanced” configuration fields.</p><p>Basic Fields:</p><p>Enable – Powers On or Off the WiFi Module hardware.</p><p>Mode – Host (Access Point) or Client (Join Network).</p><p>SSID – User can specify a Host and Client network names individually based on Mode.</p><p>Password – User can specify a Host and Client network password individually based on Mode.</p><p>Note that password requires a minimum of 8 characters.</p><p>Apply Settings – Stores and configures the WiFi Module hardware with the settings the user has modified. &lt;&lt; change the following pic&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><img src="`+p+'" id="image7"><p>Advanced Fields:</p><p>DHCP – This setting only applies to Client Mode.</p><p>Note the Address specified will be requested for use by the WiFi.
