# HDZero Micro V3 Camera

## Description

Runcam Micro V3 HDZero camera is optimized for a 16:9 aspect ratio which matches the HDZero Goggle’s 16:9 display to offer the largest and sharpest picture available for the HDZero system. The large lens attached to this camera results in superior sharpness and contrast, reduced fish-eye effect, and excellent low-light performance.

Choose between 720p60 standard resolution mode and 1080p30 high resolution modes. The later option is best for slower flying where high resolution is prioritized over frame rate whereas the 720p60 mode is best for general freestyle flying.

Compared to Micro V2, the Micro V3 offers:
-	Native 16:9 without vignetting
-	Sharper optic and better low light performance
-	Improved dust resistance
