## Power

HDZero Monitor provides two different power supply interfaces: DC(5.5mm*2.1mm) and XT30. And built-in polarity protection.

The voltage range input is 2S-6S(6-25V). Power consumption is approximately 9.0 watts when receiving HDZero video and recording.

HDZero Monitor will automatically identify cell counts based on voltage when powered on, and will alarm when the cell voltage is lower than 2.8v(flashing OSD voltage display).

You can also manually set cell counts and warning cell voltage in the HDZero Programmer App.
