Setup

The HDZero goggle has many features that can be customized to the individual pilot. 

Power Switch

There is a sliding power switch on the right side of the goggles. You may use it to turn on/off the goggle, or just leave it on and plug/unplug the DC barrel plug to turn the goggle on and off. 

In order to prevent voltage spikes entering the goggle, it is mandatory to plug in a 6S (max 4.2V /cell) battery only if the power switch is off.

Power Input/Consumption

The goggle supports 7-25.2V power input 1. Please make sure the power polarity is correct 2 (Center pin positive) before powering on the goggle.

Notes: 

DO NOT use a 6S or above HV lipo to power on the goggle, it will permanently damage the goggle. 

18650 battery cases can kill your goggle (blow the fuse). Always install batteries in correct polarity, check with case's battery checker beforehand, if the checker lights don't turn on, the batteries are installed backwards and the goggle's fuse will blow to protect the goggle. This can be repaired by replacing the fuse inside the goggles, but at owner's own cost.

RapidFire is a product of ImmersionRC limited. It is not included.

XT60 Cable

The goggle includes a 1200mm XT60 cable for connecting a battery in your pocket.  You may also purchase a shorter 90mm cable on  if you wish to locate your battery on the goggle head strap.

The XT60 cable (either 1200mm or 90mm) has no voltage regulator. The cable passes voltage directly through the goggle.

Notes: 

Do not connect an over 6S battery to the goggle, as the maximum voltage rating of the goggle is 6S (4.2V/cell).

Some types of XT60 cable, i.e., HDZero VRX cable, has integrated DC regulators. Make sure that cable is able to output enough current as indicate at Table 1. The goggle won’t boot or keep rebooting if there if that happens.  

Face Plate/Padding Foam

The goggle includes both a wide face plate and a narrow one. You may choose the appropriate one to fit your face, and use the included 7mm thick foam padding for both comfort and preventing light leakage.  

Optical Adjustment

After goggle is powered on, you will see an image on the OLED displays. Complete the following steps to adjust the optics:

Focus adjustment:  Close one eye and slowly twist the focus knob on that side of the goggle until the image comes into focus. Once it works well with one eye, repeat the process with the other eye.

IPD adjustment: Close one eye and slide the knob to center the image. Once the image is centered, repeat the process with the other eye.

Fine adjustment: Open both eyes and look at the merged image. Make small adjustments to the focus and IPD for each eye until it feels visually comfortable and merges into a single clear picture.

Note: Do not expose the lens directly to sunlight. Otherwise, the OLED displays might be damaged.

Head Strap 

The goggle includes a 50mm (2 inch) wide head strap with battery pocket. Once you have configured the face plate and padding foam for your preferred face fit, put on the head strap and adjust the tightness to your preference.

HDMI input

The HDZero goggle includes a single port HDMI 1.4b receiver through a mini HDMI port. The incoming HDMI video is routed to the OLED display without adding any frame buffer latency. 

Please note that most HDMI connectivity issues are due to either incorrect monitor settings or a faulty HDMI cable. If you encounter issues using the HDMI input, try connecting with alternative HDMI sources and alternative cables to rule out these common causes.

The current firmware supports resolution up to 1080p60 and 720p100 for HDMI input.

<div class="page"></div>

HDMI Output

The HDZero goggle includes a high-performance single channel HDMI transmitter that is fully compliant with HDMI 1.3a through a mini HDMI port.

The HDMI output will display exactly the same content as what appears on the OLED displays.

The AV input cable is not included. It is available on the  and other online stores. 

<{tag_name}><{tag_name}><{tag_name}>

                                                                                                             

                                                                                                                 

Expansion Module Bay

The HDZero goggle has an expansion module bay for installing expansion module that supports analog receiver and/or WIFI modules. 

Notes: 

HDZero goggle provides 5V power to analog receiver and in-takes its CVBS output. There are no control signals from the goggle to analog receiver. You need to tune analog receiver’s channel and menu setting by its own buttons and display.

There are two-row pins on the connector of expansion module, and a two-row socket on goggle. Make sure these 2-row pins are well seated into the 2-row socket. Analog receiver will not be able to power up if 2-row pins is one row down.

Expansion Module

Expansion module V1 supports analog receiver only, and V2 supports both analog and WIFI. Expansion modules are sold separately.<br><img src="media/image9.jpeg" id="image4">Some of expansion module may have a physical switch to power on or off the inserted analog receiver. The switch does not control the power of WIFI circuit of V2 modules. 

Except some early version of Goggle 1, all HDZero Goggle 1 and 2, there is a soft switch available in the goggle menu to turn on the power to module bay. Please note that early expansion modules cannot be controlled by this soft switch.  

Notes:

The soft switch must be turned on for the module bay to be powered and is off by default.

For Goggle 2: Although Expansion module V2 supports both analog and WIFI, its WIFI function is disable when it is insert to a Goggle 2 that has built-in WIFI already.

HT Output

The HDZero goggle has a 6-axis smart inertial measurement unit for head tracking pan+tilt support. The HT output jack pinout is shown in FIG 2.

The HT cable is not included. It is available on the  and other online stores. 

Audio Line In/Line Out

The HDZero goggle has a CTIA standard 3.5mm Line in/Line out jack for microphone and headphones. The pinout is shown in FIG 3.

Mounting Rails 

The HDZero goggle has a unique mounting rail for patch antennas or whatever else you might want to mount. 

Here is  for TrueRC patch antennas by Ryan Quellet, and  by userzero1.

FW Port

The FW port is used for flashing firmware to HDZero VTXes. A 150mm programming cable is included. 

The instruction for flashing VTX firmware is described on HDZero Firmware Update section.

 

Open Source

The HDZero Goggle is open source. You can find the SoC Firmware and Goggle CAD files at .

Video Source

The HDZero goggle can display video from any of 4 sources:

Built-in HDZero digital receiver

Built-in Analog receiver (appliable to Goggle 2 only)

AV in

Expansion Module in (such as with an analog video receiver)

HDMI in

HDZero Digital Receiver

The “Scan Now” option on the main menu will scan the following channels for an HDZero video signal:

R1-R8, E1, F1, F2, and F4 channels, or

L1-L8 if low band is selected 

“Scan Now” will perform the following: 

Scan the above channels,

Lock on to the channel if there is only one valid channel with a signal, or 

Let you choose between the channels if it has found two or more channels, or

Continue to scan after 5 seconds if no signal is detected, or

Wait for a long press of the Enter button to exit to the main menu

Notes:

 1. To enable low band, (1)VTX side: Set to Lowband at VTX menu, (2) Goggle side: set Source -> HDZero Band to Lowband. Here are the center frequencies for L1-L8.

2. Only Nano 90 camera supports 540p60 mode. When it is set to 540p60, the goggle needs to set Source > HDZero BW to Narrow.  All other modes need to set Source > HDZero BW to Wide.

Analog Input

The HDZero goggle takes analog video input from (1) the AV input jack or, (2) the external Expansion Module (not included, available on the ) or, (3) built-in analog receiver for Goggle 2. The goggle processes analog video from either of these inputs in the same way, but the Expansion Module provides an easy plug-and-play experience if you are using a standard FPV analog module. There is a soft switch available in the goggle menu to turn on the power to the module bay. This must be turned on for the module bay to be powered and is off by default.

The HDZero goggle uses a novel approach to process the analog input, resulting in improved analog video quality: 

It uses a video decoder with an adaptive comb filter to separate Y/C from the composite video;

It uses a deinterlacer to convert fields to frames, instead of doubling the interlaced lines;

It uses an upscaler to record and display the video;

Fan Management

There is one fan on the top of the goggle and one fan on each side of the goggle. All fans are soft mounted to reduce vibration and noise. There are three temperature sensors on top and sides of the goggle.

 These fans are critical to goggle performance: 

The top fan provides cooling for the OLED displays and defogging for the optical lens;

The side fans provide cooling for the IO and RF boards inside the goggle 

 They will prevent goggle from being too hot, improving OLED life span and ensuring maximum HDZero RF performance.

Top fan can be set to a 1-5, and side fans for 2-9 level, corresponding from minimum to max speed.

There are two control modes for side fans:

Automatic mode: Goggle firmware will automatically speed up/down the fan on each side; 

Manual mode: You can manually set the speed for each fan;

Regardless of the current mode, the goggle firmware will enter into rescue mode under these situations:

temperature sensor on top reports hot: top fan goes to max speed;

temperature sensor on left/right reports hot: left/right fan goes to max speed;

You can change the top fan speed by pressing and holding the Func Button. You can monitor the top fan speed changes on the goggle OSD to quickly change the amount of air blowing onto your face and the optic lenses while in the Video view. 

Notes: 

Only the side fans have automatic mode. The top fan is always in manual mode unless it is in rescue mode.

It is recommended to use automatic mode for side fans, and set top fan speed as desired level.

Image Settings

The HDZero goggle has an image processor to fine tune video before feeding to DVR and display. It includes:

Brightness

Saturation

Contrast

OLED Control

For OLED display, you may set OLED brightness to the desired level. Note that the OLED brightness setting applies to the OLED display only.

If the HDZero goggle detects no movement or no key input for programmed time (1/3/5/7 minutes), it will dim the OLED display as an alarm, and it will wait for another one minute before turning off both the display and HDZero digital receiver with a short beep. The OLED display and HDZero receiver will resume normal operation if the goggle detects movement or any key input. This feature can be disabled by setting the waiting time to “Never”.

OLED displays can provide more vivid colors than traditional LCD panels, However, if they are displaying the same content for an extended period of time, it may come across issues like "Image retention" or "Image burn-in". It is highly recommended to use the above OLED auto off feature or “Go Sleep” from main menu to turn off OLED while not using the goggle.

DVR 

The HDZero goggles integrates a DVR for both the HDZero digital receiver and analog input. These are the DVR options:

Automatic Record: DVR will start to record when it detects there is valid HDZero RF on the current channel, and stops recording when the signal is no longer detected. 

Manual Record: DVR will start/stop only if Func button is clicked. 

MP4 format or TS format: MP4 format is better supported by many video editing applications. However, MP4 files can be corrupted if the goggle loses power before the file is closed after recording, which can happen if the goggle runs out of battery or the power cord is unplugged unexpectedly. Unlike the MP4 format, the TS format saves the stream instantly to DVR without any risk of corrupted files, even if the goggle suddenly loses power. TS format is preferred. 

H264/H265. The DVR must use the H264 format when recording 90fps video (it records in 1280x720x90 for better quality). It uses the H265 format in all other cases.

Audio: You can choose to record audio or not. There are 3 audio sources that can be recorded:

Built-in microphone

Line in (From Line in/out port, usually from an external MIC)

AV in (From AV in Jack or built-in analog receiver audio output)

The file system on SD card can be corrupted by suddenly power off while goggle is writing data to it. 

HDZero Goggle operates on a Linux-based system, and it is unable to store final emergency data when powered off abruptly. This can result in corrupted SD card file systems and video files that won’t play. Here are tips on how to avoid powering off while recording is ongoing:

- Auto record mode: after quad is landed, do one of the following 

- Long press “Enter” button to switch to menu mode, then power off the goggle, or

- Power off quad first, and wait for 10 seconds, then power off the goggle

- Manual record mode:  Click “Func” button to stop DVR before power off the goggle

- Select “Scan and Fix” if Windows or Mac reports problem when SD card is inserted.

Note: It is convenient to start/stop DVR with ELRS backpack function. See .

Finally, if either page is modified “Basic” or “Advanced”, the user must return back to the “Basic” page and select “Apply Settings” in order to configure the WiFi Module.

In order to establish a wireless video stream with the HDZero Goggles via a smartphone or computer, the user must follow these steps:

The “Basic” page within the WiFi Module page will contain the necessary information in order to establish communications with the HDZero Goggles:

Host Mode – Refer to the SSID and Password fields in order to join the HDZero Goggle wireless network.

Client Mode – Refer to your wireless access point user manual.

Install VLC app (or other similar app that supports RTSP) on your device.

Open the above app, choose “Open Network Stream”, and type the RTSP URL provided by the “Basic” page footnote as it will provided the necessary URL in order to establish a video stream via VLC app, below is the default ip address if the user has not made modifications within the  “Advanced” page: 

 rtsp://192.168.2.122:8554/hdzero 

Video latency is expected due to networking protocols, buffering schema of the app, and OS platforms. 

Real Time Clock 

The HDZero Goggle includes a Real Time Clock (RTC). Goggle 1 is shipped without a pre-installed battery, whereas Goggle 2 comes equipped with one.  If the battery is missing or depleted, the device will lose its stored date and time information.  However, the RTC can still be configured via the Clock Page which will set the system clock and hardware clock upon invoking “Set Clock”. For users who have installed an aftermarket battery this only needs to be done once.  Otherwise, when the goggle boots up it will revert to the last date and time the user had specified since applying “Set Clock” command.

  

<img src="media/image19.png" id="image13">

An aftermarket battery could be CR2032 laptop battery with MX1.25-2P male connector. An example can be found .

Note: It is user’s full responsibility for any damage due to opening the goggle to install the battery.

Flashing Firmware to a HDZero VTX

The HDZero goggle can flash firmware to a HDZero video transmitter via its FW port. Here are the steps:

To flash a single VTX:

Copy HDZERO_TX.bin to root directory of a SD card that is formatted as FAT32 

Power on the goggle

Connect the VTX and HDZero goggle with the included programming cable

Go to Main menu | Firmware |Update VTX, the display will show the status of the flashing process 

Disconnect the VTX

This VTX is now flashed with the latest firmware

To flash multiple VTXes of the same type:

Copy HDZERO_TX.bin to root directory of a SD card that is formatted as FAT32 

Power on the goggle

Connect one VTX to the HDZero goggle with the included programming cable

Go to Main menu | Firmware | Update VTX, the display will show the status, 

Disconnect the VTX, this VTX is flashed

Repeat 3-5 for the other VTXes

Note: 

Flashing VTX firmware with Goggle is highly not recommended for Goggle safety consideration.  is preferred for its convenience and safety. However, a Windows system is needed to run the HDZero Programmer app, Mac is not supported for now.

Flashing Firmware to the Goggle

The HDZero Goggle runs on Linux. Its firmware contains the customized Linux distribution and its application software. We only need to update the application instead of updating the whole OS and application in most cases. However, there are some rare cases where the OS could become corrupted, such as losing power during update process. It is also possible that changes may have to be made to the OS in the future to add new functionality.

Before you start to update firmware, go to Main menu|Firmware|Current version. It should be in the following format:

n.xx.yyy, or

app:n-xx rx yy va zzz

If n is greater or equal than 9, take  Process, otherwise take .

Goggle Emergency Firmware Update Process using Phoenix App  (for all versions)

Download PhoenixCard.zip from the  site, and extract it to a location on a Windows machine, for example, C:\PhoenixCard. This is a one-time process. There is no Mac or Linux version for now.

Download the latest firmware package from the  site, and extract all files in the zip file to your local drive, i.e. C:\Temp.

Launch C:\PhoenixCard\PhoenixCard.exe; 

Follow the steps on FIG.5 to make a bootable SD card;

FIG 5. Make a bootable SD Card

Eject the SD card from Windows, and insert the SD card into the SD card slot of the goggle;

 Unplug all of the cables, i.e., HDMI in/out, Line in/out, AV in. Keep the power cable only. Power on the goggle, you will hear a long beep immediately. Wait for 3 minutes and you will hear another long beep;

Power off the goggle, and pull out the SD card from the goggle. (Do not power on goggle now);

Follow the FIG.6 to restore the SD Card from BOOT mode, and format it as FAT32 on Windows;

<img src="media/image21.png" id="image15"><img src="media/image22.png" id="image16">

FIG 6. Restore a SD Card

Copy HDZGOGGLE_RX.bin and HDZGOGGLE_VA.bin to the SD card root directory;

Insert SD card into goggle, power on the goggle, wait for 2 minutes, and there will be a long beep;

(Optional) Pull out the SD card, and check SD card contents on the PC. The 2 files should be removed if flash process is successful;

Power the goggle off and then on again.

Notes: 

(1) A bootable SD card has a hidden partition that Windows Explorer will not show. And it can’t be removed even SD card is formatted with Windows Explorer. It means the goggle will flash itself from the bootable SD card unexpectedly and mess up goggle firmware if a bootable SD card is inserted when the goggle is powered on.

(2) The above Step (5) must be followed strictly to get rid of the hidden bootable partition. Otherwise, it will brick the goggle when goggle is powered with this SD card inserted. If this happens, you will need to repeat the emergency firmware update process described in this section.

(3) Have to wait for the above specified time, DO NOT move to next step in a hurry.

(4) When the goggle is bricked, it shows HDZero Boot screen and will not get into Main menu.

OLED Display Disclaimer

Due to the nature of OLED technology, the presence of dead pixels is not uncommon and may occur during manufacturing. Please note the following guidelines:

Single dead pixel: This is considered normal and does not affect product performance.

Two consecutive dead pixels (in any direction—horizontal, vertical, or diagonal): Acceptable if the total number does not exceed four instances.

Three or more consecutive dead pixels (in any direction): This is considered abnormal and may qualify for warranty evaluation or replacement.

OLED displays can provide more vivid colors than traditional LCD panels, However, if they are displaying the same content for an extended period of time, it may come across issues like "Image retention" or "Image burn-in".

We appreciate your understanding and strive to maintain the highest quality standards.
