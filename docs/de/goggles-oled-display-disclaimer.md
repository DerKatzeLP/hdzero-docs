# OLED Display Disclaimer

1. Due to the nature of OLED technology, the presence of dead pixels is not uncommon and may occur during manufacturing. Please note the following guidelines:

    - **Single dead pixel**: This is considered normal and does not affect product performance.

    - **Two consecutive dead pixels** (in any directionâ€”horizontal, vertical, or diagonal): Acceptable if the total number does not exceed **four instances**.

    - **Three or more consecutive dead pixels** (in any direction): This is considered **abnormal** and may qualify for warranty evaluation or replacement.

2. OLED displays can provide more vivid colors than traditional LCD panels, However, if they are displaying the same content for an extended period of time, it may come across issues like "Image retention" or "Image burn-in".

*We appreciate your understanding and strive to maintain the highest quality standards.*
