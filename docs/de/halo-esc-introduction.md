The HDZero Halo ESC is a 4in1 ESC built for both racing and freestyle drone applications. It is engineered for exceptional reliability, crash resilience, and high current output—perfectly suited for the demands of drone racing.

The Halo ESC utilizes a split-board design with a dedicated MCU/driver board and a high-voltage power board, integrating 24 MOSFETs and an 8-layer PCB with over 3 oz copper thickness per layer to optimize current flow and thermal efficiency. A rear-mounted copper bar further enhances current delivery and heat dissipation. Each motor can sustain outputs over 70A for 30 seconds and peak at 100A for up to 3 seconds.

The Halo ESC supplies exceptionally clean power to the MCUs, safeguarding them against voltage spikes triggered by sudden motor acceleration or deceleration. This vital protection helps prevent MCU brownouts or lockups—common culprits behind burnt motors, failed MOSFETs, and critical flight failures.

The Halo ESC is protected with a conformal coating for enhanced resistance to moisture, dust, and corrosion.

The Halo ESC is available in two versions, BLHeli32 and AM32, to meet different pilot preferences.
