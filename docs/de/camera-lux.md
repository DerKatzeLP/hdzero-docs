# HDZero Lux Camera

## Description

The Runcam HDZero Lux camera is compact, lightweight, and durable, making it perfect for tiny whoops and micro drones. It features a ½ inch CMOS sensor that delivers sharp image quality and excellent low-light performance. Lux camera has Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) and offers higher quality by oversampling (1080p ‐> 720p). The camera outputs HD composite video (720p) via a single wire instead of a MIPI cable, reducing footprint, cost, and increasing durability.

Optimized for a 4:3 aspect ratio, it can also be configured for a 16:9 aspect ratio with a reduced vertical FOV. Designed meticulously for ultra-lightweight drones like tiny whoops, where every fraction of a gram matters, the camera boasts a large 94-degree vertical FOV, ideal for fast indoor and outdoor proximity flying.

## How to change 4:3/16:9

The HDZero AIO5 and ECO VTX lack a communication mechanism to automatically retrieve the Lux camera settings, such as aspect ratio. Users need to manually set the aspect ratio for both the AIO5/ECO VTX and the Lux camera. Here’s a short video demonstrating how to do that:
