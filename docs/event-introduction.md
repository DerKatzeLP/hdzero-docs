Designed in collaboration with racing pilots and MultiGP event coordinators, the HDZero Event VRX makes it seamless to integrate HDZero into race DVR and live stream setups. 

The Event VRX automatically switches between analog and HDZero video based on received video signal. This means separate software is not needed to switch the recorded video between the two and no special setup is needed ahead of time. 

The Event VRX outputs both HDZero and analog video on HDMI and CVBS outputs. This means you can use existing legacy analog video capture equipment such as an Owl DVR box or analog capture card, keeping cost and complexity to a minimum. 

The Event VRX packs four 2-antenna HDZero receivers into one enclosure, which reduces cost and simplifies setup. The 2-antenna HDZero receivers have less noise rejection than full goggle VRX’s with 4 antennas, but still have excellent video reception for outdoor race events. 8 analog receivers are included, setup in a diversity arrangement (2 analog receivers per channel).
