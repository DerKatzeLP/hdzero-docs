## Connection between Race V1 VTX and FC

There are 3 methods to connect the VTX and flight controller:

- Plug the included harness, cut the cables to

- appropriate length, and solder them on FC

- Use solder pads on the back of the connector

- For FCs having BEC and UART connector, install harness to the included PH2.0 connector (Shown above), and connect the harness with FC without any soldering.

::: warning
Check that pinout matches the FC pinout before installing to be safe if plugging directly.
