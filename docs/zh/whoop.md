# Whoop VTX

The HDZero Whoop VTX is a digital HD 720p 60fps video transmitter capable of delivering up to 200mW on 5.8GHz.

The power input range is 7V â€“ 17V.

**Due to the small clearance of mounting holes, make sure the mounting nuts or gummies will not overlap into the small components around the holes.**

This VTX is designed for low-speed whoop application. Compared to the other HDZero VTXes, it is more vulnerable to be damaged by crash due to: (1) the UFL connector is easily peeled off due to no antenna retention, and (2) it is not easy for soft mounting. Though the VTX can be mounted on a racing and other high-speed aircraft, it is highly recommended to consider HDZero Race V3 for such applications.<{tag_name}>

This VTX does not support Smart Audio or Tramp
