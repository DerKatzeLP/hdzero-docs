# HDZero Eco Video Video Transmitter

HDZero ECO Bundle is designed to bring digital FPV to more pilots by offering a low cost, light weight, and durable alternative to analog video. The digital video signal has stable color reproduction and 720p progressive scan video with the low latency HDZero is known for.
This budget-friendly Air Unit is a groundbreaking product—it's the first VTX/camera combination that utilizes a HD composite video signal, eliminating the need for a delicate MIPI cable.
The ECO FPV System was meticulously designed for ultra-lightweight drones like Tiny Whoops, where every fraction of a gram counts. The camera's huge 98deg vertical FOV is perfect for fast indoor proximity flying. The ECO VTX weighs approximately 4.5g, while the camera (including wires) comes in at about 1.6g. With the included 0.2g dipole antenna, the entire Eco Bundle weighs about mere 6.3g in total.
