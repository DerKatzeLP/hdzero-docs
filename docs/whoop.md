# HDZero Whoop video Transmitter (EOL)

The HDZero Whoop VTX is a digital HD 720p 60fps video transmitter capable of delivering up to 200mw on 5.8GHz.

The power input range is 7V – 17V (2S – 4S).

**Due to the small clearance of mounting holes, make sure the mounting nuts or gummies will not overlap into
the small components around the holes.**

This VTX is designed for low-speed whoop application. Compared to the other HDZero VTXes, it is more vulnerable to be damaged by crash due to: (1) the UFL connector is easily peeled off due to no antenna retention, and (2) it is not easy for soft mounting. Though the VTX can be mounted on a racing and other high-speed quad, it is highly recommended to consider HDZero Race (V1 or V2) for such application.

This VTX does not support SmartAudio or Tramp.

**Notes:**

- Read first: **General Consideration for VTX installation**

- Pay extra attention not to damage the small components when trying to remove the serrate corner
