With a tested maximum range of more than 18 miles, the Freestyle V1 VTX will transmit a digital FPV feed as far as you’re willing to fly. Not interested in long range? You’ll also see better performance in urban environments and around obstacles, with none of the color noise or multipath interference issues of analog video.&nbsp;     <img src="/media/image47.png" id="image38">

## Important Notes:

- Do not directly power this VTX with a 5S/6S battery for the 1st batch.

  - Use 2S-4S VBAT, or included BEC, or FC with built-in BEC

  - The Freestyle VTX consumes up to 15W. If it is connected with FC that has a built-in BEC output, make sure the BEC can provide enough current. For example, if the BEC provides 10V, it needs a minimum of 1.5A current output.

- Removing the heat sink is not recommended because it is part of the design.

- Rotate the antenna as shown above before detaching it to reduce the risk of peeling off the UFL connector.
