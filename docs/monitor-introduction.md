Experience seamless viewing of HDZero and Analog video feeds with the HDZero Monitor. Similar to the HDZero Event VRX that is widely used for major racing events, this monitor effortlessly detects the transmission type and displays the appropriate feed instantly. With instant power-on functionality and compatibility with a wide range of flight batteries (2s-6s voltage), you can dive into your FPV adventures without delay. The high-brightness anti-glare 800-nit screen ensures clear visibility even in outdoor settings.
