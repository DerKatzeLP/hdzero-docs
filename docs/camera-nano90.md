# HDZero Nano 90 Camera

## Description

Runcam HDZero Nano 90 camera is the first 90fps camera for HDZero VTX. This camera enables HDZero to be 5ms <strong><em>faster</em></strong> than analog 60i video to show a full field/frame.

Combined with HDZero’s extremely low latency, 90 FPS gives racers and freestyle pilots an unmatched connected flying feel and a competitive edge on the race track. You’ll finish snap rolls sharper, and corner around gates tighter at 90 FPS.

Freestylers will appreciate the new 540p60 60 FPS mode that offers better signal penetration and range by reducing HDZero’s video bandwidth.

It supports various resolutions for different flying environment.
-	720x540p90 – 90 FPS – requires HDZero Goggle
-	720x540p60 – 60 FPS at lower resolution gives better penetration/range
-	960x720p60 – 60 FPS at standard 720p resolution

Nano 90 is able to reach to 3ms pixel latency and 14ms frame latency glass to glass with the HDZero goggle.
